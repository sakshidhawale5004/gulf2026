# GulfTP Form Testing Guide

## Overview
All 4 forms submit to **one unified database table** (`form_responses`) and are identified by a `form_type` field.

## How Form Type is Determined

In `submit-form.php`:

```php
if (isset($data['service']) && isset($data['country'])) {
    $form_type = 'Contact';
} elseif (isset($data['users'])) {
    $form_type = 'Subscription';
} else {
    $form_type = 'Appointment'; // Default for basic forms
}
```

## Email Notifications

When a form is submitted:

1. **Admin receives:** HTML-formatted email to `connect@gulftp.com` with:
   - All submitted data
   - Form type
   - Submission timestamp
   - Submitter's IP address

2. **User receives:** Confirmation email to their email address with:
   - Thank you message
   - Confirmation of submission
   - Next steps (24-48 hours response time)

## Data Storage
