# GulfTP System - Quick Reference Card

## ❓ Question: Do We Need 4 Databases?

### ✅ ANSWER: NO!

**Why?** One unified table with `form_type` column is:
- Simpler
- Faster
- Easier to manage
- Better for reporting
- Industry standard

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

```
4 Forms → submit-form.php → 1 Database Table → 1 Admin Dashboard
  │          (auto-detects)      (form_responses)      (filters by type)
  │
  ├─ contact.html (service + country) → form_type = 'Contact'
  ├─ buy-subscription.html (users) → form_type = 'Subscription'
  ├─ book-an-appointment.html → form_type = 'Appointment'
  └─ update-a-search.html → form_type = 'Appointment'
```

## 📊 Database Table: `form_responses`

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | INT | Primary key |
| `form_type` | VARCHAR | Contact / Subscription / Appointment |
| `first_name` | VARCHAR | Submitter first name |
| `email` | VARCHAR | Email address |
| `service` | VARCHAR | Contact form only |
| `country` | VARCHAR | Contact form only |
| `users` | VARCHAR | Subscription form only (1-3, 4-10, 10+) |
| `message` | LONGTEXT | Additional message |
| `ip_address` | VARCHAR | Submitter IP |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Submission time |

---

## 🔍 Form Type Detection

```php
if (isset($data['service']) && isset($data['country'])) {
    $form_type = 'Contact';        // contact.html
} elseif (isset($data['users'])) {
    $form_type = 'Subscription';   // buy-subscription.html
} else {
    $form_type = 'Appointment';    // book-an-appointment.html or update-a-search.html
}
```
